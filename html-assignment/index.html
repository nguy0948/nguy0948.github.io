                My name is Sandra Nguyen. I am 20 years old. I am from Vietnam. I am International student.
                I have been Ottawa for 2 years. I just graduated from high school last year and this year is my first year in <em>Algonquin College</em>.
                Ottawa gives me a lot of interesting experiences as well as life experiences.

                I am quite an extrovert. I love to explore everything around. 
                However I am also a bit shy about some issues but I am trying to fix it. 
                I love making friends and learning from others. Taking pictures is one of my hobbies when I have free time.
            </p>
